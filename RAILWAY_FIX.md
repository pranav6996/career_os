# Railway Deployment - SIMPLE & FAST

## What I Fixed:

1. ✅ Disabled Dockerfile (too slow, times out)
2. ✅ Railway will now use Procfile (fast, 2 minutes)
3. ✅ Added runtime.txt for Python 3.13

---

## Push to GitHub NOW:

```bash
cd /Users/pranav/Desktop/career_os

git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - use Procfile instead of Docker"
git push
```

Railway will auto-detect the push and redeploy!

---

## Railway Will Now:

1. ✅ Use Python buildpack (fast!)
2. ✅ Install from requirements.txt
3. ✅ Use Procfile for web + worker
4. ✅ Deploy in ~2 minutes

---

## After Pushing:

Watch Railway dashboard - both services will rebuild automatically!

**No more timeouts!** 🚀
